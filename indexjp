  <p>  Jordan’s story
Jordan River Anderson was a First Nations child
from Norway Cree House Nation in Manitoba.
Born in 1999 with complex medical needs that
could not be treated on-reserve, he spent more
than two years in a hospital in Winnipeg before
doctors agreed that he could leave the hospital to
be cared for in a family home. However, because
of jurisdictional disputes within and between the
federal and provincial governments over who
would pay costs for in-home care, Jordan spent
over two more years in hospital unnecessarily
before he tragically died in 2005. He was 5 years
old and had never spent a day in a family home.

        In response to this tragedy, Jordan's Principle
  was created. It is a child first principle calling on
  the government of first contact to ensure First
  Nations children can access public services on
  the same terms as other children. In December
  2007, Motion-296 in support of Jordan’s
  Principle passed unanimously in the House of
  Commons.1 If the federal and provincial
  governments followed Jordan’s Principle, there
  would be no jurisdictional disputes, and First
  Nations children would not get caught in the
  middle of government red tape, like Jordan did
