        <h1 class="title">A brief History of Jordan's Principle</h1>
          <h2 class="title" <p>  Jordan’s story </p></h2>
        Jordan River Anderson was a First Nations child
      from Norway Cree House Nation in Manitoba.
      Born in 1999 with complex medical needs that
      could not be treated on-reserve, he spent more
      than two years in a hospital in Winnipeg before
      doctors agreed that he could leave the hospital to
      be cared for in a family home. However, because
      of jurisdictional disputes within and between the
      federal and provincial governments over who
      would pay costs for in-home care, Jordan spent
      over two more years in hospital unnecessarily
      before he tragically died in 2005. He was 5 years
      old and had never spent a day in a family home. </p>

      <p>   In response to this tragedy, Jordan's Principle
  was created. It is a child first principle calling on
  the government of first contact to ensure First
  Nations children can access public services on
  the same terms as other children. In December
  2007, Motion-296 in support of Jordan’s
  Principle passed unanimously in the House of
  Commons.1 If the federal and provincial
  governments followed Jordan’s Principle, there
  would be no jurisdictional disputes, and First
  Nations children would not get caught in the
  middle of government red tape, like Jordan did.</p>

  <p>    Sadly, implementation of Jordan’s Principle by
governments has been extremely limited in
scope, as noted in independent reviews by the
Canadian Paediatric Society and UNICEF in 2012.
Inadequate implementation was also brought
forward in the Pictou Landing Band Council and
Maurina Beadle v. Canada case: an application for
judicial review to address the government’s
failure to reimburse the Pictou Landing band for
costs relating to Maurina Beadle’s son Jeremy
Meawasige, who requires extensive in-home
care.2 The Federal Court found that Jordan’s
Principle is binding on the Government of
Canada and ordered it to reimburse costs for
Jeremy’s care without delay. Canada filed and
then withdrew an appeal to this ruling. </p>

<p>   Canadian Human Rights Tribunal </p>
 <p>   In August 2014, the Caring Society and Amnesty
International filed factums with the Canadian
Human Rights Tribunal stating that the federal
government’s current interpretation of Jordan’s
Principle is narrow, restrictive, ambiguous,
unlawful and discriminatory, causing denial and
delay of services to children in need. Jordan’s
Principle must be interpreted as Parliament
intended “to ensure that First Nations children
who primarily live on reserve have access to
public services on the same terms as all other
Canadian children.”3 The Tribunal has the
authority to decide if the federal government’s
implementation of Jordan’s Principle is
discriminatory pursuant to the Canadian Human
Rights Act. Learn more at www.fnwitness.ca
